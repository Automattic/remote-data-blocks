/**
 * This file may also contain CSS overrides that are difficult or impossible to
 * implement using `theme.json` alone. For example, each bound inner block of a
 * Remote Data Block has a class name corresponding to the field it is bound to.
 *
 * Therefore, a Remote Data Block named "Shopify Product" containing a paragraph
 * block bound to a field named `description` can be targeted with a selector:
 *
 * .wp-block-remote-data-blocks-shopify-product p.rdb-block-data-description {
 *   /* styles here * /
 * }
 *
 * However, note that these styles do not get applied in the editor. For simple
 * styles, using `theme.json` and the `css` property is recommended.
