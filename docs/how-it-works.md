# How It Works

At a high level, step by step, here is what is happening:

1. **Block Insertion**:

   - User adds a Remote Data Block to their post/page.
   - The block is initialized with default settings.

2. **Block Configuration**:

   - User configures the block settings in the sidebar.
   - For data-driven blocks, users can search or select specific items.

3. **Data Fetching**:

   - The block sends a request to the appropriate API or data source.
   - Data is retrieved based on the block's configuration.

4. **Data Processing**:

   - Retrieved data is processed and formatted according to the block's requirements.

5. **Rendering**:

   - The block renders the processed data within the editor.
   - On the frontend, the block displays the data to site visitors.

6. **Updates and Real-time Changes**:
   - Some blocks may support real-time updates or periodic data refreshes.
