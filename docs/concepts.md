# Remote Data Blocks: Core Concepts

## Overview

Remote Data Blocks is a WordPress plugin that enhances the Gutenberg editor by providing flexible, data-enrichable blocks. These blocks allow authors to seamlessly integrate local WordPress data, remote data, and custom layouts within the block editor.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Block-Based Architecture

The plugin leverages WordPress's block editor (Gutenberg) to create custom blocks that can fetch and display data from various sources. Each block is designed to be modular and reusable.

### 2. Remote Data Integration

The plugin allows blocks to connect with external data sources, such as:

- Airtable
- Elden Ring Map API
- Art Institute of Chicago API
- Zip Code databases
- Shopify

This enables dynamic content display directly within WordPress posts or pages.

### 3. Flexible Configuration

Each block comes with its own set of configurable options, allowing users to customize the data retrieval and display according to their needs.

### 4. Developer Extensibility

The plugin is designed to be extendable, allowing developers to create new datasources and queries to expand its functionality.

## Example: GitHub File Picker

The GitHub File Picker pattern demonstrates how remote data is integrated into a block:
