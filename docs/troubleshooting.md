# Troubleshooting and debugging

## Query monitor

Installing the [Query Monitor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) in your local development environment is highly recommended. When present, Remote Data Blocks will output debugging information to the Query Monitor "Logs" panel, including error details, stack traces, query execution details, and cache hit/miss status.

## Debugging

The [local development environment](local-development.md) includes Xdebug for debugging PHP code and a Node.js debugging port for debugging block editor scripts.
